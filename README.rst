# Yahoo API Note

  [2018-11-16] After some testing it would seem that data downloads can be
  again relied upon over the web interface (or API ``v7``)

# Tickets

  The ticket system is (was, actually) more often than not abused to ask for
  advice about samples.

For **feedback/questions/...** use the `Community <https://community.backtrader.com>`_

Here a snippet of a Simple Moving Average CrossOver. It can be done in several
different ways. Use the docs (and examples) Luke!
::

  from datetime import datetime
  import backtrader as bt

  class SmaCross(bt.SignalStrategy):
      def __init__(self):
          sma1, sma2 = bt.ind.SMA(period=10), bt.ind.SMA(period=30)
          crossover = bt.ind.CrossOver(sma1, sma2)
          self.signal_add(bt.SIGNAL_LONG, crossover)

  cerebro = bt.Cerebro()
  cerebro.addstrategy(SmaCross)

  data0 = bt.feeds.YahooFinanceData(dataname='MSFT', fromdate=datetime(2011, 1, 1),
                                    todate=datetime(2012, 12, 31))
  cerebro.adddata(data0)

  cerebro.run()
  cerebro.plot()

Including a full featured chart. Give it a try! This is included in the samples
as ``sigsmacross/sigsmacross2.py``. Along it is ``sigsmacross.py`` which can be
parametrized from the command line.

# Features:

Live Trading and backtesting platform written in Python.

  - Live Data Feed and Trading with

    - Interactive Brokers (needs ``IbPy`` and benefits greatly from an
      installed ``pytz``)
    - *Visual Chart* (needs a fork of ``comtypes`` until a pull request is
      integrated in the release and benefits from ``pytz``)
    - *Oanda* (needs ``oandapy``) (REST API Only - v20 did not support
      streaming when implemented)

  - Data feeds from csv/files, online sources or from *pandas* and *blaze*
  - Filters for datas, like breaking a daily bar into chunks to simulate
    intraday or working with Renko bricks
  - Multiple data feeds and multiple strategies supported
  - Multiple timeframes at once
  - Integrated Resampling and Replaying
  - Step by Step backtesting or at once (except in the evaluation of the Strategy)
  - Integrated battery of indicators
  - *TA-Lib* indicator support (needs python *ta-lib* / check the docs)
  - Easy development of custom indicators
  - Analyzers (for example: TimeReturn, Sharpe Ratio, SQN) and ``pyfolio``
    integration (**deprecated**)
  - Flexible definition of commission schemes
  - Integrated broker simulation with *Market*, *Close*, *Limit*, *Stop*,
    *StopLimit*, *StopTrail*, *StopTrailLimit*and *OCO* orders, bracket order,
    slippage, volume filling strategies and continuous cash adjustmet for
    future-like instruments
  - Sizers for automated staking
  - Cheat-on-Close and Cheat-on-Open modes
  - Schedulers
  - Trading Calendars
  - Plotting (requires matplotlib)

# Documentation

The blog:

  - `Blog <http://www.backtrader.com/blog>`_

Read the full documentation at:

  - `Documentation <http://www.backtrader.com/docu>`_

List of built-in Indicators (122)

  - `Indicators Reference <http://www.backtrader.com/docu/indautoref.html>`_

# Python 2/3 Support

  - Python >= ``3.2``

  - It also works with ``pypy`` and ``pypy3`` (no plotting - ``matplotlib`` is
    not supported under *pypy*)

# Installation

``backtrader`` is self-contained with no external dependencies (except if you
want to plot)

From *pypi*:

  - ``pip install backtrader``

  - ``pip install backtrader[plotting]``

    If ``matplotlib`` is not installed and you wish to do some plotting

.. note:: The minimum matplotlib version is ``1.4.1``

An example for *IB* Data Feeds/Trading:

  - ``IbPy`` doesn't seem to be in PyPi. Do either::

      pip install git+https://github.com/blampe/IbPy.git

    or (if ``git`` is not available in your system)::

      pip install https://github.com/blampe/IbPy/archive/master.zip

For other functionalities like: ``Visual Chart``, ``Oanda``, ``TA-Lib``, check
the dependencies in the documentation.

From source:

  - Place the *backtrader* directory found in the sources inside your project

# Version numbering

X.Y.Z.I

  - X: Major version number. Should stay stable unless something big is changed
    like an overhaul to use ``numpy``
  - Y: Minor version number. To be changed upon adding a complete new feature or
    (god forbids) an incompatible API change.
  - Z: Revision version number. To be changed for documentation updates, small
    changes, small bug fixes
  - I: Number of Indicators already built into the platform

## major Branches

* **master**  - Merge from Develop. QA for full integration happens here.
  Contains the last tested/verified global code integration.
* **release** - Checkout from Master. Branch based on release & tags. Bug fix in checkout branches,
  and merge with others.
* **develop** - Checkout from Master / Pull.Req from Develop. Develop new features, docs ...
* **bug** - checkout from master and pull.req. OR checkout from release branch and pull.req/Master
* **features** -  checkout Develop.

## Branch naming conventions
shall follow that of [GroupName/Info](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/273695/git-branch-naming-best-practices):

1. Use **grouping names** at the beginning of your branch names.
2. Define and use short **lead tokens** to differentiate branches in a way that is meaningful to your workflow.
3. Use slashes to separate parts of your branch names.
4. Do not use bare numbers as leading parts.
5. Avoid long descriptive names for long-lived branches.

## Grouping Names
Short and well-defined group names (used to tell you to which part of your workflow each branch belongs):
`code-block/ text`

- **rc** release candidate
- **new** major new feature, module
- **feat** addition of incremental feature/enhancement
- **bug** Bug fix
- **junk** Throwaway branch created to experiment
- **test**
- **doc** documentation (readme, code comment)

## Commit messages

Standard prefixes to start a commit message: `code-block:: text`

-   **BLD** change related to build
-   **BUG** bug fix
-   **DEP** deprecate something, or remove a deprecated object
-   **DEV** development tool or utility
-   **DOC** documentation
-   **ENH** enhancement
-   **MAINT** maintenance commit (refactoring, typos, etc)
-   **REV** revert an earlier commit
-   **STY** style fix (whitespace, PEP8, flake8, etc)
-   **TST** addition or modification of tests
-   **REL** related to releasing
-   **PERF** performance enhancements


Some commit style guidelines:

Commit lines should be no longer than `72 characters`__. The first line of the commit should include one of the above prefixes. There should be an empty line between the commit subject and the body of the commit. In general, the message should be in the imperative tense. Best practice is to include not only what the change is, but why the change was made.
